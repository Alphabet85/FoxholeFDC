# Foxhole FDC

Foxhole FDC made by Jonathan 'Alphabet' Arciaga


Used to calculate a target azimuth for an artillery piece while using a known fixed point, and a forward observer.

1 - Enter Forward Observer fixed point first.  The fixed position is the know position from the FO; distance and direction

2 - Enter artillery units and their fixed points.  The fixed position is the know position from the artillery piece; distance and direction

3 - Enter any targets and their locations based off of FO position. Distance and direction

4 - Select a target on the list and the solutions will appear at the bottom of the list for each artillery piece
